Welcome to the Vitis Data Center Acceleration Examples repository. This repository contains examples to showcase various features of the Vitis™ tools targeting Alveo Data Center platforms. It is expected that users have gone through the [Vitis HLS Introductory Examples](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-HLS-Introductory-Examples) and [Vitis Tutorials](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials) and have developed a basic understanding of the tools and the programming model. This repository illustrates specific scenarios related to host code and kernel programming through small working examples. The intention is for users to be able to use these working examples as a reference while developing their own accelerator application based on AMD Alveo platforms.
