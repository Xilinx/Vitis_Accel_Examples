Sub Devices
===========

This example demonstrates how to create OpenCL subdevices which uses a
single kernel multiple times in order to show how to handle each
instance independently including independent buffers, command queues and
sequencing.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Sub Devices

**KEYWORDS:** cl_device_partition_property, createSubDevices,
CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_EQUALLY

This example illustrates how to create ``OpenCL subdevices`` which use a
single kernel multiple times. Each of these subdevices can act as a
seperate device and can have its own command queue, buffers, sequencing
and program (However, same program can also be used). Any OpenCL API
with device as a parameter can have subdevice as a parameter as well.

.. code:: cpp

   sub_q[i] = cl::CommandQueue(sub_context, device, 0, &err);
   sub_kernel[i] = cl::Kernel(program, "krnl_vadd", &err);

Creating subdevices gives the user more control over the allocation of
compute resources in the device and high priority tasks can have
dedicated resources. Creating subdevices can also prove useful when some
portion of the device may be used for other tasks than OpenCL.

Subdevices can be divided further into more subdevices if needed. Each
subdevice has a parent device from which it is derived. Creating
subdevices doesn’t destroy the parent device and they can be used
together if needed.

OpenCL API ``clcreateSubDevices`` is used to create subdevices and
device partition properties are used to specify how the resources will
be divided among subdevices. In this example,
``CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_EQUALLY`` is used which will partition the device
into as many subdevices as possible each with the number of compute
units as mentioned in the API.

.. code:: cpp

   const cl_device_partition_property device_part_properties[3] = {
               CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_EQUALLY  ,
               1, // Use only one compute unit
               0 //CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_BY_COUNTS_LIST_END
       };
   err = device.createSubDevices(device_part_properties, &sub_devices);

Device can also be partitioned with unequal compute units for each
subdevice with ``CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_BY_COUNTS`` which allows specific
number of compute units to be assigned for each subdevice.

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary
files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is
required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during
compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/krnl_vadd.cpp

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be
executed by

::

   ./sub_devices <krnl_vadd XCLBIN>
