Device Query
============

This example prints the OpenCL properties of the platform and its
devices. It also displays the limits and capabilities of the hardware.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** OpenCL API, Querying device properties

**KEYWORDS:** clGetPlatformIDs(), clGetPlatformInfo(), clGetDeviceIDs(),
clGetDeviceInfo()

The role of this example to get the details of all the OpenCL Devices
connected to system. Platform IDs and Device IDs can be extracted using
Open CL APIs which are subsequently needed to configure the context and
command queues for communication between host and device. Example first
searches the all connected Platforms using clGetPlatformIDs() API. Then
it traverses to each Platform and finds all the connected devices using
clGetDeviceIDs(). Then it traverses all the devices and print all device
properties like device type, vendor id etc.

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary
files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is
required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during
compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be
executed by

::

   ./device_query
