Global Memory Two Banks 
========================

This example of 2ddr is to demonstrate how to use multiple ddr and create buffers in each DDR.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Multiple Banks

**KEYWORDS:** max_memory_ports, sp, connectivity


This example demonstrates how buffers can be created in two different
DDR(Global memory) banks.

By default, all the memory interfaces from all the kernels are connected
to a single global memory bank. As a result, only one memory interface
at a time can transfer data to and from the memory bank, limiting the
performance of the kernel. If the FPGA contains only one DDR (or global)
memory bank, this is the only option. However, some FPGA devices contain
multiple DDR memory banks which allows us to customize the connections
among the kernel memory interfaces and the DDR memory bank of a device
by altering the default connection.

Seperate bundle names need to be specified for each buffer to be placed
in different bank.

.. code:: cpp

   #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port = input offset = slave bundle = gmem0
   #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port = output offset = slave bundle = gmem1

This example uses watermark application to demonstrate the utilization
of multiple DDRs for full bandwidth. Input image is placed into
``Bank0`` and kernel will read the input Image and write the output
image to ``Bank1``. Banks need to be specified using ``sp`` tags in
apply_watermark.ini file along with the port name and kernel name.

   sp=apply_watermark_1.input:DDR[0]
   sp=apply_watermark_1.output:DDR[1]

EXCLUDED PLATFORMS
------------------

Platforms containing following strings in their names are not supported for this example :

::

   zc
   zed
   vck
   u50
   samsung

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   data/golden.bmp
   data/input.bmp
   src/apply_watermark.cpp
   src/host.cpp
   
COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./host -x <apply_watermark XCLBIN> -i ./data/input.bmp -c ./data/golden.bmp

COMMANDS FOR WINDOWS FLOW
-------------------------

Once the environment has been configured, run the following commands :

::

   cd cmake_build
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DXILINX_XRT=<set xilinx xrt path> -DOCL_ROOT=<set ocl root path>
   cmake --build . --verbose --config Debug --target install

   For Example : 
   cd cmake_build
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DXILINX_XRT=C:\Xilinx\XRT -DOCL_ROOT=C:\Xilinx\XRT\ext
   cmake --build . --verbose --config Debug --target install
