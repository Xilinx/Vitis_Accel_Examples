Compilation and Execution
=========================

It is primarily recommended to start with Hello World example which makes the new users aware about the basic structure of an Scout based Application.

Compiling for Application Emulation
-----------------------------------

As part of the capabilities available to an application developer, Scout includes environments to test the correctness of an application at both a software functional level and a hardware emulated level.

These modes, which are named sw_emu and hw_emu, allow the developer to profile and evaluate the performance of a design before compiling for board execution.
It is recommended that all applications are executed in at least the sw_emu mode before being compiled and executed on an FPGA board.

::

    cd <PATH TO SAMPLE APPLICATION>
    make all TARGET=<sw_emu|hw_emu> DEVICE=<FPGA Platform>

where,

	*sw_emu = software emulation*
	*hw_emu = hardware emulation*


**NOTE:** The software emulation flow is a functional correctness check only. It does not estimate the performance of the application in hardware.

The hardware emulation flow is a cycle accurate simulation of the hardware generated for the application. Also, it is expected for this simulation to take a long time.

Executing Emulated Application
------------------------------
*(Recommended Execution Flow for Example Applications in Emulation)*

The makefile for the application can directly executed the application with the following command:

::

    cd <PATH TO SAMPLE APPLICATION>
    make check TARGET=<sw_emu|hw_emu> DEVICE=<FPGA Platform>

where,

	*sw_emu = software emulation*
	*hw_emu = hardware emulation*

If the application has not been previously compiled, the check makefile rule will compile and execute the application in the emulation mode selected by the user.

Compiling for FPGA Accelerator Card
-----------------------------------

The command to compile for the FPGA acceleration
board is:

::

    cd <PATH TO SAMPLE APPLICATION>
    make all DEVICE=<FPGA Platform> TARGET=<hw>

**NOTE:** Compilation for hardware generates custom logic to implement the functionality of the kernels in an application.
It is typical for hardware compile times to range from 30 minutes to a couple of hours.
