Stream Kernel to Kernel Vector Increment 
=========================================

This is a simple Vector Increment RTL Kernel to Kernel design with 1
Stream input and 1 Stream output that demonstrates on how to process an
input stream of data for computation in an application.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Read/Write Stream, Create/Release Stream, RTL Kernel

**KEYWORDS:** cl_stream, CL_STREAM_EOT

This example demonstrates the use of RTL kernels for addition with
stream interfaces. Two kernels, ``my_adder1`` and ``myadder2`` are
connected by a stream interface. Each kernel simply increments the input
by 1 and returns the result. Kernel to kernel stream interfaces need to
be specified in the kernel linking stage via a ``.ini`` file in the
following manner.

::

   stream_connect=myadder1_1.out:myadder2_1.in

RTL kernels can be integrated to Vitis using ``RTL Kernel Wizard``.
These kernels have the same software interface model as OpenCL and C/C++
kernels. That is, they are seen by the host application as functions
with a void return value, scalar arguments, and pointer arguments.

The RTL Kernel Wizard automates some of the steps that need to be taken
to ensure that the RTL IP is packaged into a kernel that can be
integrated into a system in Vitis environment. A ``kernel.xml`` file is
generated to match the software function prototype and behavior
specified in the wizard.

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary
files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is
required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during
compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/gen_xo_myadder1.tcl
   src/gen_xo_myadder2.tcl
   src/host.cpp

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be
executed by

::

   ./vadd_stream <myadder XCLBIN>
