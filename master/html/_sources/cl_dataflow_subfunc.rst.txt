Dataflow SubFunction OpenCL
===========================

This is simple example of vector addition to demonstrate how OpenCL
Dataflow allows user to run multiple sub functions together to achieve
higher throughput.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** SubFunction Level Parallelism

**KEYWORDS:** xcl_dataflow, xclDataflowFifoDepth

This example demonstrates how ``xcl_dataflow`` attribute can be used to
implement task level parallelism for subfunctions inside a function.

``adder`` kernel uses a function ``run_subfunc`` which has 3
subfunctions ``read_input``, ``compute_add`` and ``write_result``.
``xcl_dataflow`` is used here to parallelize these subfunctions inside
``run_subfunc``.

.. code:: cpp

   __attribute__ ((xcl_dataflow))
   void run_subfunc(__global int *in, __global int *out, int inc, int size)
   {
       int buffer_in[BUFFER_SIZE];
       int buffer_out[BUFFER_SIZE];

       read_input(in,buffer_in,size);
       compute_add(buffer_in,buffer_out,inc,size);
       write_result(out,buffer_out,size);
   }

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary
files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is
required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during
compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/adder.cl
   src/host.cpp

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be
executed by

::

   ./host <adder XCLBIN>
