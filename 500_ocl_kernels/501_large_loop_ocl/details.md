## 1. HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE REPOSITORY
To get a local copy of the SDAccel example repository, clone this repository to the local system with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples examples
```
where examples is the name of the directory where the repository will be stored on the local system.This command needs to be executed only once to retrieve the latest version of all SDAccel examples. The only required software is a local installation of git.

## 2. SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Board | Device Name | Software Version
------|-------------|-----------------
Xilinx Alveo U250|xilinx_u250_xdma_201820_1|SDx 2018.3
Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ VCU1525|xilinx_vcu1525_dynamic|SDx 2018.3
Xilinx Alveo U200|xilinx_u200_xdma_201820_1|SDx 2018.3


*NOTE:* The board/device used for compilation can be changed by adding the DEVICES variable to the make command as shown below
```
make DEVICES=<.xpfm file path> all
```
## 3. DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY
Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

```
.gitignore
Makefile
README.md
description.json
details.md
qor.json
sdaccel.ini
src/cnn_convolution.cl
src/cnn_convolution_bad.cl
src/defns.h
src/host.cpp
utils.mk
```

## 4. COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
### Compiling for Application Emulation
As part of the capabilities available to an application developer, SDAccel includes environments to test the correctness of an application at both a software functional level and a hardware emulated level.
These modes, which are named sw_emu and hw_emu, allow the developer to profile and evaluate the performance of a design before compiling for board execution.
It is recommended that all applications are executed in at least the sw_emu mode before being compiled and executed on an FPGA board.
```
make all TARGET=<sw_emu|hw_emu> DEVICE=<FPGA Platform>
```
where
```
	sw_emu = software emulation
	hw_emu = hardware emulation
```
*NOTE:* The software emulation flow is a functional correctness check only. It does not estimate the performance of the application in hardware.
The hardware emulation flow is a cycle accurate simulation of the hardware generated for the application. As such, it is expected for this simulation to take a long time.
It is recommended that for this example the user skips running hardware emulation or modifies the example to work on a reduced data set.
### Executing Emulated Application 
***Recommended Execution Flow for Example Applications in Emulation*** 

The makefile for the application can directly executed the application with the following command:
```
make check TARGET=<sw_emu|hw_emu> DEVICE=<FPGA Platform>

```
where
```
	sw_emu = software emulation
	hw_emu = hardware emulation
```
If the application has not been previously compiled, the check makefile rule will compile and execute the application in the emulation mode selected by the user.

***Alternative Execution Flow for Example Applications in Emulation*** 

An emulated application can also be executed directly from the command line without using the check makefile rule as long as the user environment has been properly configured.
To manually configure the environment to run the application, set the following
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$XILINX_SDX/runtime/lib/x86_64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export XCL_EMULATION_MODE=<sw_emu|hw_emu>
emconfigutil --platform 'xilinx_vcu1525_dynamic' --nd 1
```
Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by
```
./host ./xclbin/cnn_GOOD.<emulation target>.<device name>.xclbin ./xclbin/cnn_BAD.<emulation target>.<device name>.xclbin
```
This is the same command executed by the check makefile rule
### Compiling for Application Execution in the FPGA Accelerator Card
The command to compile the application for execution on the FPGA acceleration board is
```
make all DEVICE=<FPGA Platform>
```
The default target for the makefile is to compile for hardware. Therefore, setting the TARGETS option is not required.
*NOTE:* Compilation for application execution in hardware generates custom logic to implement the functionality of the kernels in an application.
It is typical for hardware compile times to range from 30 minutes to a couple of hours.

## 5. Execution in Cloud Environments
FPGA acceleration boards have been deployed to the cloud. For information on how to execute the example within a specific cloud, take a look at the following guides.
