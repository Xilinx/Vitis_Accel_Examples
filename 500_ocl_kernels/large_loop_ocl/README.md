Clock Frequency ~ Large Loop Count (CL) 
======================

This is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based example which mainly focuses on Convolution operation of a CNN network. The goal of this example is to demonstrate a method to overcome kernel design timing failure issue. It also presents the effectiveness of using multiple compute units to improve performance.

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** Clock Frequency, Multiple Compute Units, Convolutional Neural Networks

***KEYWORDS:*** xcl_array_partition, xcl_pipeline_loop, always_inline
