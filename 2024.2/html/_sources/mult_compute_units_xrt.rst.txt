Multiple Compute Units XRT (XRT Native API's) 
==============================================

This is simple Example of Multiple Compute units to showcase how a single kernel can be instantiated into Multiple compute units. Host code will show how to use multiple compute units and run them concurrently using XRT Native api's.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** `Multiple compute units <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Symmetrical-and-Asymmetrical-Compute-Units>`__

**KEYWORDS:** `nk <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/connectivity-Options>`__


This example explains how to create multiple instances of a kernel and
execute them concurrently using xrt native api's.

For the same kernel to be instantiated into multiple compute units,
``nk`` flag is used to specify the number of compute units in a ``.cfg``
config file as shown below:

::

   [connectivity]
   nk=vadd:4

**EXCLUDED PLATFORMS:** 

 - All NoDMA Platforms, i.e u50 nodma etc

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/vadd.cpp
   
Access these files in the github repo by `clicking here <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/master/host_xrt/mult_compute_units_xrt>`__.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./mult_compute_units_xrt -x <vadd XCLBIN>
