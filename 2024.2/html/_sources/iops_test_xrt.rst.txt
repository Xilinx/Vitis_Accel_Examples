IOPS Test XRT (XRT Native API's)
================================

This is simple test design to measure Input/Output Operations per second. In this design, a simple kernel is enqueued many times and measuring overall IOPS using XRT native api's.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Input/Output Operations per second


This is simple test design to measure Input/Output Operations per second using xrt native api's.
For measuring the IOPS we run kernel 1 Million times and capture the time it takes to complete -

Following is the real log reported while running the design on U250
platform:

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/hello.cpp
   src/host.cpp
   
Access these files in the github repo by `clicking here <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/master/performance/iops_test_xrt>`__.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./iops_test_xrt -x <hello XCLBIN>
