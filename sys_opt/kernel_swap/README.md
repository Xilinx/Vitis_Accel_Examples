Kernel Swap
======================

This example shows how host can swap the kernels and share same buffer between two kernels which are exist in separate binary containers. Dynamic platforms does not persist the buffer data so host has to migrate data from device to host memory before swapping the next kernel. After kernel swap, host has to migrate the buffer back to device.

***KEY CONCEPTS:*** Handling Buffer sharing across multiple binaries, Multiple Kernel Binaries

***KEYWORDS:*** enqueueMigrateMemObjects, CL_MIGRATE_MEM_OBJECT_HOST

## EXCLUDED PLATFORMS
Platforms containing following strings in their names are not supported for this example :
```
zcu102_base_202010
zcu104_base_202010
vck
zc7
```

##  DESIGN FILES
Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

```
src/host.cpp
src/krnl_vadd.cpp
src/krnl_vmul.cpp
```

##  COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by
```
./vmulvadd <krnl_vmul XCLBIN> <krnl_vadd XCLBIN>
```

##  COMMANDS FOR WINDOWS FLOW
Once the environment has been configured, run the following commands : 
```
cd cmake_build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DXILINX_XRT=<set xilinx xrt path> -DOCL_ROOT=<set ocl root path>
cmake --build . --verbose --config Debug --target install

For Example : 
cd cmake_build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DXILINX_XRT=C:\Xilinx\XRT -DOCL_ROOT=C:\Xilinx\XRT\ext
cmake --build . --verbose --config Debug --target install
```
