Host Memory Simple XRT (XRT Native API's)
=========================================

This is simple host memory example to describe how a user kernel can access the host memory using xrt native api's.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** `host memory <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Best-Practices-for-Host-Programming>`__, address translation unit

**KEYWORDS:** host_only, `HOST[0] <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Mapping-Kernel-Ports-to-Memory>`__


This example illustrates the use of ``host_only`` Buffer which resides
in the host memory and directly transferred to/from the kernel

.. code:: cpp

   xrt::bo::flags flags = xrt::bo::flags::host_only;
   auto bo0 = xrt::bo(device, size_in_bytes, flags, krnl.group_id(0));

Using host_only flag we mention that the buffer is host only buffer
and the flag is passed as argument during buffer creation.


**EXCLUDED PLATFORMS:** 

 - Alveo U25 SmartNIC
 - Alveo U30
 - Alveo U50lv
 - Alveo U50 gen3x4
 - All Embedded Zynq Platforms, i.e zc702, zcu102 etc
 - All Versal Platforms, i.e vck190 etc
 - All Platforms with 2019 Version
 - All Platforms with 2018 Version

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/kernel.cpp
   
Access these files in the github repo by `clicking here <https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/master/host_xrt/host_memory_simple_xrt>`__.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./host_memory_simple_xrt -x <krnl_vadd XCLBIN>
