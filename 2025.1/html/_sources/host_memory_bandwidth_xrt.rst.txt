Host Memory Bandwidth XRT (XRT Native API's)
============================================

This is host memory bandwidth example to describe host memory and kernel bandwidth test using native xrt api's.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** `host memory <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Best-Practices-for-Host-Programming>`__, bandwidth, address translation unit

**KEYWORDS:** host_only, `HOST[0] <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Mapping-Kernel-Ports-to-Memory>`__


This is a host application to test Host Memory bandwidth. It contains 3 kernels namely read_bandwidth, write_bandwidth and bandwidth (for concurrent read and write).The host application runs all 3 kernels with variable buffer sizes and measures the bandwidth for each case. Finally the design reports the maximum bandwidth achieved for each case.

The host allocates a buffer into specific host-only buffer using ``host_only`` flag.

.. code:: cpp

   xrt::bo::flags flags = xrt::bo::flags::host_only;
   auto hostonly_bo_in = xrt::bo(device, bufsize, flags, krnl.group_id(0));
   auto hostonly_bo_out = xrt::bo(device, bufsize, flags, krnl.group_id(1));

Using the ``sp`` option  in the krnl_bandwidth.cfg file, AXI-Master Port is connected to the Slave-Bridge IP:

::

   sp=bandwidth_1.input0:HOST[0]
   sp=bandwidth_1.output0:HOST[0]
   sp=read_bandwidth_1.input0:HOST[0]
   sp=write_bandwidth_1.output0:HOST[0]

Following is the real log reported while running the design on U250 platform:
