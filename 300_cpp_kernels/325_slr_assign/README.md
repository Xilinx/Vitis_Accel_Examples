======================

This is simple example to describe SLR assignment information for a platform design. This example highlights how to provide extra input to assign the logic of the kernel into a nominated SLR. In this example we are assigning first kernel(Vector Multiplication) to SLR0 and assigning the second kernel(Vector Addition) to SLR1
